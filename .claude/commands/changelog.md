# Update Changelog

Review the recent work and update CHANGELOG.md with the changes.

Follow these steps:

1. **Check recent changes**: Run git status and git diff to see what files were modified
2. **Identify the type of changes**:
   - Added: New features, files, or functionality
   - Changed: Updates to existing features
   - Fixed: Bug fixes
   - Removed: Deleted features or files
   - Security: Security improvements

3. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add entries to the [Unreleased] section at the top, or to the current version section if one exists

4. **Format properly**: Follow the existing changelog format with clear, concise descriptions

If the [Unreleased] section doesn't exist yet, ask the user if they want to add it to the changelog structure.

Be specific about what changed and why it matters to users/developers.
